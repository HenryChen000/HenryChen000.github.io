                        Excerpt: 2nd mvt, 15:18–22:40
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first time I heard this piece was during my freshman year in a general education course on classical music. My professor would play some of the most famous works by each composer when introducing them, and when it came to Mahler, he played Mahler's Symphony No. 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back then, I wasn’t very familiar with classical music and just felt that the piece sounded chaotic, so I didn’t listen to it again. However, after I had spent some time exploring classical music, I realized that Mahler's Symphony No. 1 is an important work. I kept encountering it in class, on YouTube, and on social media, so I decided to listen to it more attentively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I started listening to the piece more attentively, I finally began to grasp the shape of its melody and realized that it’s a very successful and brilliant work. The second movement, in particular, is not only exceptionally beautiful, but its melody also carries a rhythm that’s both relaxing and makes you want to dance. Every time I finish listening to the second movement, I feel like I’ve had a glass of wine—it’s truly amazing.
