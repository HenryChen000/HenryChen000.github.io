                        <h1>Henry Chen's history</h1>
                        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is listening to classical music recordings on YouTube. However, while organizing some of the albums I truly love, I realized that YouTube’s playlist feature didn’t quite meet my needs. So, I decided to build a system of my own to better organize these recordings.</p>
                        <p>But I also felt that it would be a waste for such a system to exist for just one person. At the same time, I wanted to share these wonderful recordings with others. After making some improvements, this website was born.</p>
                        <h1>Biography</h1>
                        <p>When I was a freshman, I took a general education course on classical music. Before taking the class, I didn’t know much about classical music. That changed when the professor played Beethoven’s Violin Concerto one day — it was then that I started to find classical music really interesting. Later, while preparing for the midterm paper and exam, I was under a lot of pressure to maintain a good GPA, so I listened to classical music every day from morning till night. During that time, I came to realize just how beautiful classical music is, and that’s when I truly fell in love with it.</p>
